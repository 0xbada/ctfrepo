## Rules
* Each team is only allowed to participate under one name.
* There is no restriction on the number of team members.
* If you have questions about tasks, ask moderators in IRC chat or Email. No points will be deducted for these questions.
* If this is the first time you play over, you should know that a flag is a sentence or code that you should find in each level. There is no exact procedure to find them, you have to do several tests and think out of the box to get them. Eventually you'll understand the dynamics of the CTF and how to quickly solve challenges.
* If you are sure your flag is true (we mean %100 SURE), but our system does not accept it, inform us via chat.
* Reporting bugs in the contest infrastructure has a reward.
* Thou shalt not be a jerk. We are all here to learn something new.
* Any attempt for disrupting the contest will result in disqualification.
* We have a dynamic scoreboard. That means the more teams solve a challenge, the less point each team gets.
* All flags must be in this form: `ASIS{[0-9a-zA-Z_-]+.}`, unless the contrary is stated.
* Flag example: `ASIS{_some_l33t_string_l1k3_7hi5_}`
* There would be at least 24 tasks.
* The address of the live chat channel is irc.hackint.org #asis-ctf
* You can find latest news and announcements about this contest on the announcements page.
* Registration will be open until the end of the game.
