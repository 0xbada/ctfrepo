# Re: Plaid Party Planning (Plaid CTF 2018)

* 200 pts

## Description

>>>
Last year, we planned a party but had some issues with multiple people working at the same time. This year, we've improved communication, but everyone is far away. We need to find the best place to host the after-party minimizing total travel time.

Note: All of the food needs to be picked up.

Can you help? If so, please contact `pppr.chal.pwning.xxx:3444`.
