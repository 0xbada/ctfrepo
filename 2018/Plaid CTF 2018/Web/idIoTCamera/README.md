# idIoT: Camera (Plaid CTF 2018)

* 150 pts

## Description

>>>
The idIoT also has an FTP server(`https://play.plaidctf.com/files/ftp_59c6b909078aedec36611df263c6faf6c319f15d`) running on his laptop on port 1212, and has a WiFi camera that sends it images 3 times per second. We can probably see some interesting stuff if we can get some images from that camera.

(Please do not attempt to locate or attack the camera directly. Only attack the FTP server. You will probably need to use your attack from idIoT: Action as a starting point.)
