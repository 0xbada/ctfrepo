# idIoT: Action (Plaid CTF 2018)

* 200 pts

## Description

>>>
Some people won't let any smart devices in their home at all. Some are cautious, do their research, and make an informed decision. This guy falls in neither category; he's a a downright idIoT.

The idIoT uses this service called clipshare(`https://idiot.chal.pwning.xxx/`); you can find his account here(`https://idiot.chal.pwning.xxx/user.php?id=3427e48e-a6eb-4323-aed4-3ce4a83d4f46`) after you make an account.

He was telling me the other day about how he has a Google Home next to his computer running at all times. He also told me that if you ask politely it will tell you the flag. However, while he'll look at anything you share, he closes it almost immediately if he doesn't seem like it'll interest him. Maybe we can look at his clips to find something to match his interests?

(Flag format: `PCTF{xxx}` where xxx is some text composed of lower-case letters and underscores)
