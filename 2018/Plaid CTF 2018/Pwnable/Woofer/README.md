## Description

>>>
This old boye(`https://play.plaidctf.com/files/woofer-linux_2eb93531fe3b981d91529bc40aff95a40064cfec.tgz.gpg`)'s memory isn't what it used to be, but wow he sure can write a correct typechecker! Hopefully there were no other problems lurking in the background... Source code is encrypted with gpg --symmetric. The passphrase is the flag to doggo.
