# 3ISC-ABC (Plaid CTF 2018)

* 400 pts

## Description

>>>
A spirited reverse engineer should be good at critical reading of programs in all languages, from verilog to C, from b3s23(`https://legitbs.net/statdump_2016/challenges/2.html`) to lisp. If you have at least a bit of spirit of reversing, then you better show us here before time runs out!

DISCLAIMER: We will not provide another chance for you to show a "spirit" of reversing if you do not show your awesomeness here within a reasonable amount of time.
