# ARM Coder (BSidesSF 2018 CTF)

## Description

>>>
Perhaps you've experienced our Intel shellcode testing service. Well, we also offer it in ARM! If you'd like, you can test your shellcode with this service as well. Since it's a cloud service, we've got it in a sandbox, but I trust that's no trouble for you.
